= DevOps Enabling Your Team

Slides and code for presentation at GR8Conf EU - 2017

== Abstract

Once you have successfully developped your application in Grails, Ratpack or your other favorite framework, you would like to see it deployed as fast and painless as possible, right?

This talk will cover some of the supporting cast members of a succesful modern infrastructure, that developers can understand and use efficiently, and with good DevOps practices.

Key elements are

* Docker
* Infrastructure as Code
* Container Orchestration

The demo-goods will hopefully be on our side, as this talk includes quite some live demos!
